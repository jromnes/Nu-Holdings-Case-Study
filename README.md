*David Vélez Osorno, Christina Helena Zingaretti Junqueira, & Adam Edward Wible*

* __How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?__ 

    Nubank was created with the purpose of helping individuals overcome the complexity of financial services. Nubank uses technology and innovation to create solutions to ease the credit card and digital banking experiences for low-to-medium income individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses. The first goal of the company was to create a credit card service that would not be linked to any specific bank, it would be exclusively and completely digital, and it would be extremly user friendly without a majority of the typical fees that credit card users face when dealing with traditional credit cards.

* __How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?__ 

    Nubank received a total of $4.2B since the founding of the company. Nubank has participated in 15 rounds of funding, the most recent being from a Post-IPO Debt round on January 17,2023. Initially, it was difficult for the founders of Nubank to find investors due to the Brazilian start-up scene, which was extremely concentrated by large and traditional companies, and specifically hostile towards fintech start ups. This left the initial funding of Nubank in the hands of the co-founders. 

    Insight on Nubank's first round of funding: One of Nubank's founders, David Vélez, utilized his past employment experiences and his network to seek funding through international venture capitals. Nubank received an investment of $2 million, classified as a *seed investment*, from Sequoia Capital and Kaszek Ventures on July 5th, 2013. This initial investment was vital for the growth of Nubank, not only financially, but it also helped build trust and brand awareness. This intitial investment was the starting point of contact between Nubank and Mastercard, which is still the credit card brand used by Nubank for all transactions.
    
    The types of funding transactions that Nubank has participated in include, but is not limited to: Post-IPO Debt, Post-IPO equity, Series G, Series F, Secondary Market, Series E, Debt Financing, & Series D transactions. 
    
    Nubank has been funded by 35 investors including International Finance Corportion, Morgan Stanely, Berkshire Hathaway, Sequoia Captital, FJ Labs, Tiger Global Management, Founders Fund, and Goldman Sachs. 


## Business Activities

* __What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?__ 
    
    Nubank is currently attacking multiple problems simultaneously. These problems include: offering higher credit limits for low income clients, reducing the tariffs involved with the use of credit cards, and providing completely digital services available anywhere. The problems that Nubank is currently tackling and trying to solve makes this company and their products attractive to the low and medium income classes of South America, specifically Brazil.

    Nubank calls what their company does everyday the *purple revolution*. The purpose of the purple revolution is: fighting complexity in the financial sector, giving people access to the system, and empowering them to control their financial lives. 

* __Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?__

    Since Nubank is fully digital, intended customers need to have access and be able to utilize a smartphone. They also need to be willing to accept the idea of a digital bank versus a traditional physical bank. Nubank raises brand awareness alsmot completely via social media marketing, this narrows down the target consumer niche. 
    
    With all things considered, the most effective target group would be the millennials. Millenials are individuals that were born during the rise of the digital area, they are the generation most comfortable with the digital revolution. Millennials also have more interactions with social media, meaning they are more likely to see Nubank advertisements compared to an individual with a lack of use and understanding when it comes to social media. Around 72% of Nubank's clients are millennials.
    To narrow the target audience further, we can take notice to the social classes of Nubank's customers. Due to needing a working smartphone to utilize Nubank's products, a large percentage (up to 70%) of Nubanks customers are in the upper to middle class.

* __What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)__

    In 2017, Nubank release their "Rewards" product. While the concept of a "rewards" product is not uncommon in the world of credit cards, Nubank provided their customers with no expiration date for points gained via "rewards". Other credit card business have an expiry date that points need to be used up by, but Nubank allows their rewards points to have lifetime value. This is a major advantage over other credit card companies, mainly because the points expiry date hinders the customer's ability to save and accumulate points for a larger rewards.

    Nubank also seperated rewards into two separate groups: "extra" rewards and "flights and hotel" rewards. The "extra" rewards aggregates everyday expenses such as cinema tickets and streaming services. The "flights and hotel" rewards for airplane tickets, hotels, and other non-ordinary expenses.

* __Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)__

    Nubank gained access to state of the art AI through the acquisition of Olivia, a company specializing in advanced AI algorithms. 
    
    Through the acquisition of Cognitect, a leading software consultancy firm, Nubank was able to expand it's technological capabilities. Nubank can now advance it's systems for reliability, scalability, and modularity. 

    Nubank relies on statues like adaptability, immutability, functional programming, modularization, CI/CD to foster quick and reliable maintenence to it's systems.

* __How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?__

    Nubank's competitors can be separated into two types: Traditional banks and other fin-techs. Traditional banks hold the largest threat over Nubank maily due to the current market power that they have. The main traditional banking competitors: Caixa Economica (32% in 2017); Banco do Brasil (19%); Itau Unibanco (12%); Bradesco (10%); and Santander (9%). 

    Caixa and Banco do Brasil are government controlled banks, there large consumer based is due to the majority of the Brazilian lower class that utilizing one of these bank. These are the basic banking options for a large portion of the population.

    The latter 3 of the traditional bank competitors are private banks with strong brand morale due to being present for decades. These private banks have been exploring the innovative envirnment of digital banking since the start of the fintech revolution, making these private banks the most "direct" competitors of Nubank. 

    Nubank became a huge success early into the rise of digital banking, which triggered the start up of many other fin-tech companies. There are three main fin-tech competitors that have had quick growth, making them worth mentioning as competitors: Digio, Neon, and Intermedium.

    __Digio__: has smaller rotative fees than Nubank and doesnt have a queue to create the credit card, but proved to be less user friendly. Digio is similar to Nubank, with a few differences in the products offered, yet Digio suffered/is suffering from not being the first entrant in the market.

    __Neon__: only offers debt services, there are no rotative fees due to no credit card. In order to compensate the lack of revenue stream, Neon charges uses for withdrawals and transfers between banks. 

    __Intermedium__: Nubank's newest competitor; offers credit and debit services. Intermedium offers the lowest rotative fees, but lacks an extensive client base which delays it's growth.


## Recommendations

* __If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)__

    I would suggest expanding Nubank's rewards syetm by adding crypto as a redeemable reward. Similar to Coinbase's crypto rewards program with their debit cards. This would allow the user to convert points into different types of crypto, or potetially the crypto currency of the user's choosing. This would allow a new collaboration between the domains of digital banking and cryptocurrency.

* __Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?__

    I think the addition of a crypto rewards service would help bridge the gap between traditional currency and cryptocurrency through digital banking services. I also think that it would attract a larger portion of millenials as well as Gen Zs. This would largely be caused by the sharp peak of interest that the crypto and investing world has received from the younger generations. It would so possibly allow participation in the crypto market to be even more accessible. 

* __What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?__


    | Technology | Purpose |
    | :----------: | :----:|
    | Blockchain Technology | A suitable blockchain platform (e.g., ETH, Binance Smart Chain, or perhaps a custom blockchain) is crucial. Smart contratcs for managing all transactions and reward distribution are one reason why blockchain technology is necessary. |
    | Cryptocurrency Wallets | Cryptocurrency wallets would be needed to store and manage the rewards that the user would be receiving. |
    | Credit Card Integration | In order to integrate credit card transactions with the rewards program, it is important to work with payment processors. Credit card integration can help ensure compliance with financial regulations and security standards. |
    | APIs and Middleware | APIS need to be implemented to connect the credit card transactions to the blockchain and reward distribution system. The use of middleware is to facilitate communication between different parts of the system. |
    | Security Measures | In order to protect user data and transactions, robust security measures like encryption and secure key management would be useful. |
    | User Authentication and Authorization | Authorization mechanisms are needed to control access to various parts of the system. The development of a secure authentication system for consumers would need to happen as well. |
    | Data Storage | Data storage is needed to store personal information of users, transaction history, and any other relevant data. |
    | Scalability Solutions | Having a solid plan for scalability would make is easier to handle a growing user base and larger transaction volumes. |
    | Compliance and Legal Considerations | To ensure that the crypto rewards program is compliant with financial regulations and privacy laws. Know Your Customer(KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering(AML) procedures need to be implemented. |
    | User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) | A user friendly interface is needed for web and mobile applications. This will allow a seamless experiance for users to see and utilize their rewards. |
    |  Analytics and Reporting | The implementation of analytics tools to track user behavior, transaction patterns, and program performance will assist in generating reports for users and administrators. |
    | Monitoring and Maintenance | Monitoring tools can be set up to detect and respond to system issues quickly. COnsistently updating and maintaining the system will ensure better security and performance.|
