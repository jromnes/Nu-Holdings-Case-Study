# Nubank Case Study


## Overview and Origin

    Nubank

* __When was the company incorporated?__

    
    The company was founded on May 6th, 2013.

* __Who are the founders of the company?__

    David Vélez Osorno, Christina Helena Zingaretti Junqueira, & Adam Edward Wible

* __How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?__ 

    Nubank was created with the purpose of helping individuals overcome the complexity of financial services. Nubank uses technology and innovation to create solutions to ease the credit card and digital banking experiences for low-to-medium income individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses. The first goal of the company was to create a credit card service that would not be linked to any specific bank, it would be exclusively and completely digital, and it would be extremly user friendly without a majority of the typical fees that credit card users face when dealing with traditional credit cards.

* __How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?__ 

    Nubank received a total of $4.2B since the founding of the company. Nubank has participated in 15 rounds of funding, the most recent being from a Post-IPO Debt round on January 17,2023. Initially, it was difficult for the founders of Nubank to find investors due to the Brazilian start-up scene, which was extremely concentrated by large and traditional companies, and specifically hostile towards fintech start ups. This left the initial funding of Nubank in the hands of the co-founders. One of Nubanks founders, David Vélez, utilized his past employment experiences and his network to seek funding through international venture capitals. Nubank received an investment of $2 million, classified as a *seed investment*, from Sequoia Capital and Kaszek Ventures on July 5th, 2013. This initial investment was vital for the growth of Nubank, not only financially, but it also helped build trust and brand awareness. This intitial investment was the starting point of contact between Nubank and Mastercard, which is still the credit card brand used by Nubank for all transactions. On September 25th, 2014, Nubank received an *Series A* investment of $14.3 million, once again funded by Sequoia Capital and Kaszek Ventures, and angel investors. This funding was mainly needed to allow the public release of their mobile app. After the quick growth of the company, following the *Series A* funding, a new round of funding began for Nubank. Nubank received  a new round of investments, classified as *Series B* invesments, of $30 million on July 2, 2015 made by Tiger Global Management, Sequoia Capital, Kaszek Ventures and QED Investors.   The funding transaction types that Nubank has participated in include, but is not limited to: Post-IPO Debt, Post-IPO equity, Series G, Series F, Secondary Market, Series E, Debt Financing, and Series D. Nubank has been funded by 35 investors including International Finance Corportion, Morgan Stanely, Berkshire Hathaway, Sequoia Captital, FJ Labs, Tiger Global Management, Founders Fund, and Goldman Sachs. 


## Business Activities

* __What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?__ 
    
    Nubank is currently attacking multiple problems simultaneously. These problems include: offering higher credit limits for low income clients, reducing the tariffs involved with the use of credit cards, and providing completely digital services available anywhere. The problems that Nubank is currently tackling and trying to solve makes this company and their products attractive to the low and medium income classes of South America, specifically Brazil.

* __Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?__

    Since Nubank is fully digital, intended customers need to have access and be able to utilize a smartphone. They also need to be willing to accept the idea of a digital bank versus a traditional physical bank. Nubank raises brand awareness alsmot completely via social media marketing, this narrows down the target consumer niche. 
    
    With all things considered, the most effective target group would be the millennials. Millenials are individuals that were born during the rise of the digital area, they are the generation most comfortable with the digital revolution. Millennials also have more interactions with social media, meaning they are more likely to see Nubank advertisements compared to an individual with a lack of use and understanding when it comes to social media. Around 72% of Nubank's clients are millennials.
    To narrow the target audience further, we can take notice to the social classes of Nubank's customers. Due to needing a working smartphone to utilize Nubank's products, a large percentage (up to 70%) of Nubanks customers are in the upper to middle class.

* __What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)__

    In 2017, Nubank release their "Rewards" product. While the concept of a "rewards" product is not uncommon in the world of credit cards, Nubank provided their customers with no expiration date for points gained via "rewards". Other credit card business have an expiry date that points need to be used up by, but Nubank allows their rewards points to have lifetime value. This is a major advantage over other credit card companies, mainly because the points expiry date hinders the customer's ability to save and accumulate points for a larger rewards.

    Nubank also seperated rewards into two separate groups: "extra" rewards and "flights and hotel" rewards.
